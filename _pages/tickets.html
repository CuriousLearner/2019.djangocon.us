      <h2>What ticket should I buy?</h2>
      <p>If your employer is paying your way then please pick the <strong>Corporate</strong> or <strong>Corporate Patron</strong> rate. State or government institutions and non-profit organizations should use the corporate rate if they are able. If you work for a small company, or the corporate rate is not reasonable for your company, then please pick the <strong>Individual</strong> rate. If you are a student, unemployed, on a lower income, or feel you would benefit from a reduced-priced ticket, please pick the <strong>Student/Diversity</strong> rate.</p>

   <h2>Ticket Types</h2>
   <p><strong>Corporate ($695 Early Bird, then $795):</strong> If your employer (with more than 5 employees) is paying for your ticket. State or government institutions and non-profit organizations should use the corporate rate if they are able.</p>
   <p><strong>Corporate Patron ($995):</strong> Every year, particularly generous attendees ask how they can pay extra for their ticket to help us expand our mission. This year, we're introducing this ticket type just for you. The cost difference will be put toward conference expenses that increase access to the conference, such as the financial aid fund and video captioning. Ticket holders of this type receive all the benefits of a corporate ticket, and will also be invited to a special "thank you" event at the conference.</p>
   <p><strong>Corporate Conference Package ($1,285):</strong> If your company prefers to purchase several tickets and tutorial sessions at once and register the names of the people attending at a later date, this ticket is for you. It includes a corporate-level ticket + two tutorial sessions. You can give us the name(s) of who is attending the conference, as well as the tutorials they would like to attend, at a later date.* We will also send you a paper invoice for record-keeping if you need.</p>
    <p><strong>Individual ($495 Early Bird, then $595):</strong> If your company has 5 or fewer employees, or if you’re purchasing your own ticket without any help from your employer.</p>
    <p><strong>Student/Diversity ($295):</strong> If you’re unemployed, on a lower income, are a member of an underrepresented group, or would benefit from a lower-priced ticket for another reason. <strong>If your company is paying for your ticket, you are not eligible for this ticket type.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Tutorials ($195):</strong> They are a separate cost from your conference ticket. You can register for a tutorial without registering for the conference itself. You must register for a specific tutorial.</p>
    <p><strong>Sprints (free):</strong> The ticket is free, but we ask you to register so we can buy you lunch. You do not have to register for the conference itself to register for sprints.</p>
    <br />
    <p><em>*We encourage you to claim your tutorial slot soon after tutorials are announced; if a tutorial sells out before you claim your slot, we cannot guarantee you a spot in that session. But we'll do our best to send you lots of reminders.</em></p>

      <li>Between October 8 and October 13, 2018, the cancellation fee is 50%.</li>

    </ul>
