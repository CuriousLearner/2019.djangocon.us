      <h2>What ticket should I buy?</h2>
      <p>If your employer is paying your way then please pick the <strong>Corporate</strong>, <strong>Patron</strong>, or <strong>Corporate Concierge Service</strong> rate. State or government institutions and non-profit organizations should use the Corporate or Corporate Concierge Service rate if they are able. If your company employs 5 or fewer people, or you're buying your ticket on your own, then please pick the <strong>Individual</strong> rate. If you are a student, unemployed, on a lower income, or feel you would benefit from a reduced-priced ticket, please pick the <strong>Student/Diversity</strong> rate.</p>

   <h2>Ticket Types</h2>
    <p><strong>Individual ($495 Early Bird, then $595):</strong> If your company has 5 or fewer employees, or if you’re purchasing your own ticket without any help from your employer.</p>
    <p><strong>Corporate ($695 Early Bird, then $795):</strong> If your employer (with more than 5 employees) is paying for your ticket. State or government institutions and non-profit organizations should use the corporate rate if they are able.</p>
    <p><strong>Patron ($995):</strong> Every year, particularly generous attendees ask how they can pay extra for their ticket to help us expand our mission. This year, we're introducing this ticket type just for you. The cost difference will be put toward conference expenses that increase access to the conference, such as the financial aid fund and video captioning. Ticket holders of this type receive all the benefits of a corporate ticket, and will also be invited to a special "thank you" event at the conference.</p>
    <p><strong>Corporate Concierge Service ($995 per ticket):</strong> If your company wants to purchase several tickets in advance, but decide who will be attending the conference at a later date, feel free to use the Corporate Concierge Service. Buy your tickets in bulk and we'll send you a registration code your employees can use to register when you're ready. We will also send you a paper invoice for record-keeping if you need.</p>
    <p><strong>Student/Diversity ($295):</strong> If you’re unemployed, on a lower income, are a member of an underrepresented group, or would benefit from a lower-priced ticket for another reason. <strong>If your company is paying for your ticket, you are not eligible for this ticket type.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Tutorials ($195):</strong> They are a separate cost from your conference ticket. You can register for a tutorial without registering for the conference itself. You must register for a specific tutorial.</p>
    <p><strong>Sprints (free):</strong> The ticket is free, but we ask you to register so we can buy you lunch. You do not have to register for the conference itself to register for sprints.</p>
