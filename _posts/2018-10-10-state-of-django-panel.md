title: "Introducing the State of Django Panel!"

We’re pleased to announce a new event for DjangoCon US 2018--the State of Django Panel. :sparkles: We’ve gathered folks from across the Django community to discuss where we are and where we’re going. The panel will close out the last day of talks. Some topics may include:

- Continuing to grow the Django community
- Creating a welcoming space for beginners
- Priorities for ongoing development of Django core
- Diversity and inclusion
- Success stories (e.g. Django Girls, regional events)
- Ways to improve Django events
- What we can learn from other software communities
- What makes the Django community special? What are we doing well?

We would also like to hear what *you* are interested in seeing the panel discuss! Please fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/XVfHTIOxzQod2ClI3) to submit your question for the panelists.
