title: "Labcodes - DjangoCon US"
---

This is Labcodes first time sponsoring DjangoCon US, and we couldn't be more excited to be a major part of it. Besides that, we're giving two brand new talks with Renato and Luan, and also Nicolle's talk, that was highly praised earlier this year in the PyCon.

Luan is talking about an issue that hits hard on every digital product: [technical debt](https://2019.djangocon.us/talks/technical-debt-why-it-ll-ruin-your/). In his talk, he'll be focusing on what are technical debts and how to avoid them. Renato is talking about [Django authentication](https://2019.djangocon.us/talks/understanding-django-authentication/), the importance of it and the possibilities you have once you understand it. Nicolle, on the other hand, is going to be talking about [the importance of internationalization and localization for digital products and how it may go a long way in improving your user's experience](https://2019.djangocon.us/talks/eita-why-internationalization-and-matter/).

Sharing our knowledge with the community, learning, improving, and meeting new people are among our favorite things (along with coding, obviously). We're very happy to be helping DjangoCon become such a fruitful event.
