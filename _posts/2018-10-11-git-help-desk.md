title: "Git Help Desk for Sprints"
---

We are excited to try something new with our sprints this year! In order to make it easier for the sprint leaders to focus on sprinting, we are setting up a Git Help Desk to help sprinters with their commits. If you’re interested in helping out at DjangoCon US, please consider volunteering for the help desk. You don’t have to be an expert, but if you are willing to pair program with someone until they find their solution, please [sign up to be a part of the Git Help Desk](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nq9y8STris2rC3DfX7hQte-FB4E8cDCuHPu5-ZbsjO0/edit#gid=0)!

For the sprint newbies or anyone who wants a refresher, we will also be holding a Introduction to Contributing to Open Source session at 9:00 AM, Thursday, October 18, in Cabrillo 1-2, hosted by Jeffrey Eliasen.
