Play a free round of mini golf with the Caktus team! This is the ninth
year [Caktus Group](https://www.caktusgroup.com/?utm_source=djangoconsite&utm_medium=blog01&utm_campaign=djangocon2018)
has sponsored DjangoCon US, and this year they’re hosting a mini golf
event that’s open to all DjangoCon attendees. 
Whoever shoots the lowest score will win a **$100 Amazon gift card.***

Look for the Caktus insert in your conference tote bag. On the back of
the insert is a free pass to Tiki Town Adventure Golf for **Tuesday,
