## Python Packaging without the Pain
Sunday, October 14, 9:00 AM - 12:30 PM  
Presented by: [Diane DeMers Chen](http://twitter.com/purplediane88)  
Level: Intermediate

Many of us have snippets of Python code we copy from project to project. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could `pip install` them from PyPI instead of copy-pasting everywhere? But packaging has always been a complicated, scary task. We will take you from copy/paste to `pip install` in one tutorial!

## API-Driven Django
Sunday, October 14, 9:00 AM - 12:30 PM  
Presented by: [Philip James](http://twitter.com/phildini)  
Level: Intermediate  

Django comes with a robust templating system, but more and more web applications are focusing on its API abilities.
In this tutorial, we’ll take advantage of Django and django-rest-framework. You’ll come away knowing how to get a rich API and a frontend prototype out of single Django views.

## Web Application Security with Django: A Hands-On Tutorial
Sunday, October 14, 9:00 AM - 12:30 PM  
Presented by: [Jacinda Shelly](http://twitter.com/jacindashelly)  
Level: Intermediate

Too often, web security is treated as a something “the framework takes care of.” Not today! In this tutorial, we will use live Django instances that have some security flaws. We’ll find the flaws, see the consequences, and learn how to fix and prevent these in our own applications.

## What To Expect When You’re Expecting: A Hands-On Guide to Regression Testing
Sunday, October 14, 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM  
Presented by: [Emily Morehouse-Valcarcel](http://twitter.com/emilyemorehouse)  
Level: Intermediate

We all know we should be testing our applications, but testing is hard and great testing is even harder. Take a deep dive into what and how to test your Django apps, plus learn how to leverage modern headless browser libraries and automated visual diff-ing to get (and keep) pixel-perfect apps.

## Build a GraphQL API powered by Django
Sunday, October 14, 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM  
Presented by: [Ed Rivas](http://twitter.com/je92rivas)  
Level: Intermediate

GraphQL is changing the way we develop APIs, and leading tech companies are using it as an alternative to REST to power their applications. In this workshop you’ll learn how to leverage your existing Django expertise to build a powerful and feature-rich API, no experience with GraphQL required!

## Mastering the Django ORM
Sunday, October 14, 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM  
Presented by: [James Bennett](http://twitter.com/ubernostrum)  
Level: Intermediate

Django’s ORM is probably its most-used but also least-understood component. This tutorial will try to fix that, by teaching you about best practices for using the ORM, advanced features you might not have known about, and technical details of how it all works under the hood.

Each session is $195 and runs about 3 hours. You can [buy tickets](https://ti.to/defna/djangocon-us-2018) for tutorials in the same place that you buy admission to the conference itself.
