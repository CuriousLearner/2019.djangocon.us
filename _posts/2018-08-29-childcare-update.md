Back in June, we [announced our childcare survey](/news/childcare-survey/) to ask about the needs of our attendees when it comes to childcare at DjangoCon US. Childcare at conferences and DjangoCon US in particular is an important factor that helps folks attend who otherwise may not be able to come. We gathered your feedback, spoke with local childcare providers, and we have some updates about childcare at DjangoCon US.

The San Diego Marriott pointed us to [Destination Sitters](https://www.destinationsitters.com/), a service where certified and vetted sitters come directly to your hotel room and bring a bag of toys for your little ones to play with. There's no need to arrange a pick-up and drop-off at a faraway daycare.

* **Booking:** Destination Sitters recommends you book a sitter 2-3 weeks in advance although they may be able to accommodate shorter notice. To book a sitter, you can [book online](https://www.destinationsitters.com/book-a-hotel-babysitter/) or call <a href="tel:+18887485439">(888) 748-5439</a>.
* **Payment:** DjangoCon US will reimburse you for childcare (up to $XXX per day) with a receipt. To request a reimbursement, please email [hello@djangocon.us](mailto:hello@djangocon.us). Destination Sitters' [rates are posted on their website](https://www.destinationsitters.com/about-us/#sdca).
* **Other accommodations:** Destination Sitters is not exclusive to the Marriott. If you are staying at another hotel or at a private rental, they can still help.

We look forward to seeing you in a few months in San Diego!
