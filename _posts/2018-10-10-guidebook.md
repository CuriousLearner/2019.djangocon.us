title: "Plan your Conference with Guidebook! "
---

DjangoCon US is partnering with Guidebook for the fourth year in a row to bring the conference schedule right to your mobile device! 

Using Guidebook as our program instead of a traditional paper program enables us to save money, reduce our environmental impact, and ensure that any last-minute schedule additions or changes get communicated to you immediately.

With Guidebook, you can select the talks and other events you want to attend, receive reminders before the sessions you definitely don't want to miss, get to venue maps before you get lost, and reach important phone numbers in case of an emergency.

We're all huge fans of Guidebook and know you will be, too. Download the [Guidebook app](https://guidebook.com/g/djangocon18/) and search for "DjangoCon US 2018" to start planning your DjangoCon US experience!
