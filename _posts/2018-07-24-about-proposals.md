title: "About Our Proposals"
---

Every year at DjangoCon US, we think the proposals can't get any better. And every year, you prove us so, so wrong. This year, we had a record-breaking number of proposals and enough high-quality content to extend DjangoCon US to several more days or a few more tracks. That kind of expansion isn't in the budget for this year, but you can see the [talks and tutorials](https://2018.djangocon.us/news/announcing-our-program/) we chose!

So let's talk about proposal numbers:

:pencil: We had 259 total submissions, a 5.7% increase over last year

:microphone: That includes 230 talks (12 more than last year) and 29 tutorials (2 more than last year)

:date: More than a third of our proposals were received the weekend of the deadline

:eyes: Over 40 organizers and members of the Django community signed up to review talks and tutorials (thanks again for your help, y'all!)

:heavy_division_sign: Our acceptance rate was 17.8%, making this a particularly competitive year

We’re very proud of the schedule we’ve put together and want to thank everyone who submitted a talk or proposal, even if it wasn’t selected. The quality of submissions was top notch, and we hope to see many of your proposals at other conferences or at DjangoCon US 2019.

Thanks also to all of our reviewers! We couldn’t have done this without you.

We are confident that DjangoCon US 2018 will be a great conference with amazing talks and tutorials. We hope to see you in San Diego this October! :desert_island:
