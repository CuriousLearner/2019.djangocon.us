title: "Catch That Worm! Early Bird Tickets On Sale Now"
---
We know you're as excited as we are to get your DjangoCon US ticket, and your wait is over! Tickets are [on sale now]({{site.ticket_link}}) and more information is available on our [tickets](/tickets/) page.

Here's what you need to know:

## Prices

- Early Bird Individual Rate: $495 (will increase to $595 once early bird tickets sell out)
- Early Bird Corporate Rate: $695 (will increase to $795 once early bird tickets sell out)
- **New Ticket** &mdash; Patron Rate: $995
- **New Ticket** &mdash; Corporate Concierge Service: $995 per ticket (will not change)
- Student/Diversity Rate: $295 (will not change)
- Tutorials: $195 per session

**Patron:** Every year, particularly generous attendees ask how they can pay extra for their ticket to help us expand our mission. This year, we're introducing a ticket type just for you: the Patron ticket. The cost difference will be put toward conference expenses that increase access to the conference, such as the financial aid fund and video captioning. Ticket holders of this type receive all the benefits of a corporate ticket, and will also be invited to a special "thank you" event at the conference.

**Corporate Concierge Service**: If your company wants to purchase several tickets in advance, but decide who will be attending the conference at a later date, please use our Corporate Concierge Service. Buy your tickets in bulk and we'll send you a registration code your employees can use to register when you're ready. We will also send you a paper invoice for record-keeping if you need.

## Which ticket should I buy?

If your company (of more than 5 people) is paying for your ticket, please choose the **Corporate** rate or the **Patron** rate. If your company would like to purchase several tickets and register specific attendees later, consider the **Corporate Concierge Service**. State or government institutions and nonprofits should use the Corporate or Corporate Concierge Service rate if they are able.

If you are paying your own way, or if your company has 5 or fewer employees, please use the **Individual** rate. If you're feeling especially generous, you're welcome to use the **Patron** rate.

If you are a student, unemployed, on a lower income, or feel you would benefit from a reduced-priced ticket, please use the **Student/Diversity** rate. If your company is paying for your ticket, you are not eligible for this ticket type.

You can also pre-register for tutorials! Just add a morning and/or afternoon tutorial session to your order, and we'll send you a registration code once our tutorial schedule is released. (Please choose specific tutorials as soon as possible once the schedule is released; we cannot guarantee you a slot in a specific session but we'll do our best to send you lots of reminders.)

## Refunds

We would hate for you to miss the conference! But we know things come up, so here's our refund policy.

- Refunds requested by September 30, 2018 incur a 10% cancellation fee.
- Between October 1 and October 7, 2018, the cancellation fee is 25%.
- Between October 8 and October 13, 2018, the cancellation fee is 50%.

Tickets may be transferred to someone else at no charge by October 13 for tutorials and October 14 for the conference.

For all dates the cutoff is on or before 5:00 PM PDT per the timestamp on DEFNAâ€™s servers.
