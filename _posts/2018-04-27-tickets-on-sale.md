title: "Catch That Worm! Early Bird Tickets On Sale Now"
---
We know you're as excited as we are to get your DjangoCon US ticket, and your wait is over! Tickets are [on sale now]({{site.ticket_link}}) and more information is available on our [tickets](/tickets/) page.

Here's what you need to know:

## Prices

- Early Bird Corporate Rate: $695 (will increase to $795 once early bird tickets sell out)
- **New Ticket:** Corporate Patron Rate: $995
- **New Ticket:** Corporate Conference Package &mdash; Ticket + 2 Tutorials: $1,285 (will not change)
- Early Bird Individual Rate: $495 (will increase to $595 once early bird tickets sell out)
- Student/Diversity Rate: $295 (will not change)
- Tutorials: $195 per session

**Corporate Patron:** Every year, particularly generous attendees ask how they can pay extra for their ticket to help us expand our mission. This year, we're introducing a ticket type just for you: the Corporate Patron ticket. The cost difference will be put toward conference expenses that increase access to the conference, such as the financial aid fund and video captioning. Ticket holders of this type receive all the benefits of a corporate ticket, and will also be invited to a special "thank you" event at the conference.

**Corporate Conference Package**: We know some attendees work for companies that prefer to purchase several tickets and tutorial sessions at once and register the names of the people attending at a later date. If this is you, feel free to use the Corporate Conference Package to purchase a corporate-level ticket + two tutorial sessions. You can give us the name(s) of who is attending the conference, as well as the tutorials they would like to attend, at a later date. (**Note:** we encourage you to claim your tutorial slot soon after tutorials are announced; if a tutorial sells out before you claim your slot, we cannot guarantee you a spot in that session. But we'll do our best to send you lots of reminders.) We will also send you a paper invoice for record-keeping if you need.

## Which ticket should I buy?

If your company (of more than 5 people) is paying for your ticket, please choose the **Corporate** rate or the **Corporate Patron** rate. If you are planning on attending two tutorials, consider the **Corporate Conference Package**. State or government institutions and nonprofits should use this rate if they are able.

If you are paying your own way, or if your company has 5 or fewer employees, please use the **Individual** rate.

If you are a student, unemployed, on a lower income, or feel you would benefit from a reduced-priced ticket, please use the **Student/Diversity** rate. If your company is paying for your ticket, you are not eligible for this ticket type.

## Refunds

We would hate for you to miss the conference! But we know things come up, so here's our refund policy.

- Refunds requested by September 30, 2018 incur a 10% cancellation fee.
- Between October 1 and October 7, 2018,, the cancellation fee is 25%.
- Between October 8 and October 13, 2018, the cancellation fee is 50%.

Tickets may be transferred to someone else at no charge by October 13, 2018, for tutorials and October 14 for the conference.

For all dates the cutoff is on or before 5:00 PM PDT per the timestamp on DEFNAâ€™s servers.
