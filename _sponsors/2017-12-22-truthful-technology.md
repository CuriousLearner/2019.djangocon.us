      Trey Hunner helps Python & Django teams turn experienced devs into experienced Python devs through on-site team training. Trey's custom training sessions are always hands-on because learning primarily happens from doing. All new skills learned are re-enforced through comparisons and analogies to already understood technologies. All skills are acquired through coding, reflecting, and re-solving programming exercises individually or as a group. If you have a team of developers who need to learn Python & Django better, contact Trey Hunner. I would love to chat with you.
