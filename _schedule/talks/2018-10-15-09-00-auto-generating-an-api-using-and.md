abstract: We have an API whose database schema changes constantly with no need for
  changes to our code that exposes the data. This is an extremely powerful (but quite

We have an API whose database schema changes constantly with no need for changes to our code that exposes the data. This is an extremely powerful (but quite possibly a bad) idea. See how we do it!

In this talk I'll go over:

* Introspecting the database
* Dynamically generating Django models
* Dynamically generating a DRF API
* Testing against read-only databases
* How it's all a powerful (but maybe a bad) idea
