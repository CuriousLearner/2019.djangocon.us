- bio: |
    Kojo Idrissa *was* an accountant who got an MBA and taught at university in
    two different countries. He's *now* a new(ish) software engineer and is still
    trying to figure that out and grow into the role. He's spoken at tech conferences
    about spreadsheets, contributing to tech communities, Dungeons & Dragons, inclusion
    and privilege. You can find him online at http://kojoidrissa.com/ or as
    [@transition](https://twitter.com/Transition) on Twitter.
