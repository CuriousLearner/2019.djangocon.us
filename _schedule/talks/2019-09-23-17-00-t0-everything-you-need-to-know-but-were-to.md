abstract: You know you're curious. How are data classes different from other Python
  classes? Why can't I just use a dictionary? How do I even use these in my existing
  applications? Come on a cross-language comparative journey to discover just what
  are, and how best to use, Python 3.7's classiest new feature.

- bio: Casey Faist is the Queen Snake of Heroku, where she builds the Python deployment
    experience. She previously built dockerized sandbox environments for the browser,
    parsed AST trees, and engineered data. She likes hugs, sharks, and thinks combining
    those things would be awesome when done very carefully.

What makes this better than using a normal object or dictionary? Are they actually more memory efficient? Why shouldn't I just write my own dunder methods for this? Come explore the ins, outs, and whys of Data Classes by looking at them from lenses both inside and outside of Python! Comparing language features might be pitting apples against oranges, but sometimes, it's just as important to know what a feature is not to use it effectively. So let's throw some comparative color onto the pep - we may just find the perfect spot in your developer toolbox for the data class to live. Join me for this can't miss deep dive into data classiness.
