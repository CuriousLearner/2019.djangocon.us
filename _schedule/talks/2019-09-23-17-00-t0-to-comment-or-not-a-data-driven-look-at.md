abstract: How can someone who is just learning find the commenting style that is best
  for them as they learn, grow, & contribute? I did a survey of programmers & will
  be sharing what we can do to address comment use in a way that encourages a growth
  mindset and empowers everyone.

- bio: "Before becoming a programmer, Veronica was a researcher with an eye for process
    improvement (she helped pick the Mars Curiosity Rover’s landing site!). She loves
    exploring the web and teaching, and speaks on building the tooling & docs you
    need and has co-taught a PyCon tutorial on using web-scraping and machine learning
    to predict Oscar winners. When she isn’t thinking about how the web can be better
    for developers, she enjoys blogging and snuggling as many cats as possible.\r\n\r\nPast

title: To comment or not? A data-driven look at attitudes toward code comments
track: t0

---

Every programmer has asked themselves “how many comments are too many?” To the newest programmers, comments may seem magical--a way of documenting without giving instructions to the computer. But commenting engages the same vulnerability as more advanced challenges (i.e. pair programming & code review) and is likely to pique the insecurity of many programmers (especially the copy-and-paste or tutorial-level programmer)!

While most of us agree that commenting is part of writing maintainable code, it’s very difficult for someone who has not yet worked in a community-reviewed codebase to know what is good practice and not. The answers that come back often conflict each other: Code should be DRY, but well-placed comments save future devs. How can someone find the commenting style that is best for them as they learn, grow, & contribute? My survey of 170 long-time developers, Computer Science majors, bootcamp grads, & hobby programmers confirms some expectations and brings others into question. Join me for a data-based chat about the biggest pain points caused by our attitudes toward commenting and the steps we can take to encourage a growth mindset and empower programmers of all levels.
