Django tutorials often use the perspective of a complete newcomer to Python and web development, and while they provide a good practical on-ramp for brand new developers, they are often not quite right for developers from other backgrounds.

The common backbone of MVC development, no matter the base language, is the database and the language specifically for it's manipulation: Structured Query Language (SQL). But Django hides this behind it's amazing drawcard, the Object Relational Model (ORM).

But how can a developer already familiar with SQL get a handle on the ORM?

This talk endeavours to introduce the ORM using shared SQL and relational database concepts, showcasing the features the ORM uses to make database querying and manipulation a joy, rather than a burden, to the polyglot developer.
