This tutorial will be suitable for complete beginners in Wagtail and Vue.js, but those with some experience in Django and JavaScript will make more progress. By the end of the session, attendees will have built and deployed a Wagtail backend with an API, together with a Vue.js frontend. They'll understand the costs and benefits of headless versus server-rendered architectures, and they'll have a codebase which they can continue to build on, long after DjangoCon US has finished!
