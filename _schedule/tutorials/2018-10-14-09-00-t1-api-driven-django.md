As the web continues to evolve, the demand for data-driven backends matched with rich frontend experiences grows every day. Django comes with a robust templating system and rendering engine, but more and more web applications using Django are just focusing on its API abilities.

What if we could have the best of both worlds? What if we could use Django and django-rest-framework to write views that let us prototype quickly using the Django templating system, and have those same views return API responses to rich clients?

In this tutorial, we’ll build a sample data collection and display web application, taking advantage of the ways Django and django-rest-framework work together. The end result will be a web application you could adapt for many kinds of data collection needs, and you’ll come away knowing how to get a rich API and a frontend prototype out of just one Django view.

- Introduction
- Getting environments set up
- What’s different about what we’re trying to do?
- Writing our first universal view
- Break!
- More views, and talking about authentication
- Wrapping up, questions
