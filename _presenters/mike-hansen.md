Mike is a long-time Django and Python user.  He's currently a software engineer at Rover where he's been able to use Django for the last 5 years to help everyone be able to experience the love of dogs.  Outside of work, he loves playing board games, doing math, and taking his two chihuahuas, Megatron and Myoki, on hikes.
