Ever since Blythe graduated with an MS & BS from Carnegie Mellon in 2000, she has been moving data with ORMs. Although she almost became a DBA after becoming certified, she has spent most of her career in web development squeezing performance out of various web frameworks. When she is not advocating for or creating maintainable software, she is snowboarding, enjoying various types of sportsball, and hanging out with her best friend, Sounders the Cat, in Seattle. Blythe previously was co-founder and principal architect at Spongecell (Flashtalking merger). She has been Django-ing at Rover.com for over 3 years.
